Quizzical App

This is final project for the React Basics section of the Scrimba Front End Developer course. It's presented as solo challenge, with no guidance and a Figma file to work from.

This is deliberately challenging and is designed to use all skills learned on the course so far. It's also designed to challenge the dev with having to use skills they don't currently have to more accurately mimic a real-world scenario.

This was a real challenge with passing props, functions, nested arrays/nested mapping and conditional rendering all featuring. It was a lot of fun though and I was sure to rigorously comment on my own code as I suspect I'll need to refer to it in the future.
